# Vehicle Accidents Data Analysis 🚗💥📊

This repository contains the results of an in-depth data analysis project focused on a dataset of vehicle accidents. The primary objective of this project was to enhance SQL skills and derive valuable insights from the data. 

## Project Overview 📝

In this case study, we explored the vehicle accidents dataset and addressed six key questions to uncover significant findings. The questions we aimed to answer are as follows:

1. **Comparison of Accidents in Urban and Rural Areas:** We examined and compared the number of accidents occurring in urban areas with those in rural areas to understand any notable differences.

2. **Day of the Week with Highest Accident Volume:** We determined which day of the week experiences the highest volume of accidents, providing insights into potential patterns or trends.

3. **Average Age of Vehicles Involved in Accidents by Vehicle Type:** We calculated the average age of vehicles involved in accidents and broke it down by vehicle type, enabling us to identify any variations across different vehicle categories.

4. **Weather Conditions and Accident Severity:** We investigated whether specific weather conditions contribute to more severe accidents, potentially highlighting the impact of weather on road safety.

5. **Left-side Vehicle Impacts:** We analyzed whether accidents tend to involve impacts on the left-hand side of vehicles, offering insights into possible patterns or driver behaviors.

6. **Relationship Between Journey Purpose and Accident Severity:** We explored potential relationships between the purpose of the journey and the severity of accidents, aiming to identify any noteworthy associations.

## Repository Structure 📂

The repository is structured as follows:

- **Queries:** This folder contains SQL queries used to extract, transform, and analyze the vehicle accidents dataset. Each query corresponds to one of the six key questions addressed in the project.

- **Screens:** This folder includes visual representations, such as charts, graphs, or diagrams, generated during the data analysis process. These screens provide a visual reference for the insights derived from the dataset.
